<p>☕Although I don´t take coding that seriously, considering that my work area is completely apart from computers and engineering in general, I still enjoy tinkering a bit with programming languages in general (python and JS being the only languages I actually tried to study a bit)</p>
<p>🌐Also into website development, even though I am extremely lazy and can't even finish a single web page</p>
